            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Alex Brown. I am the youngest out of 5 brothers and 1 sister including me. 
                I am also a twin. We are identical twins. People get us mixed up a lot including my parents but 
                I don't understand how they don't see a difference in me and my twin. They say we look alike but I don't see it and never will. 
                I love to play video games, play with my friends, ride my bike, and stay up late. 
                Some video games I play include, Fortnite, GtaV, Minecraft, Roblox, and more. 
                I usually play with my friends when I am on the game and sometimes outside because some of them live near me. 
                My mongoose is the bike that I ride with. I ride with my two brothers and play basketball with them whenever we go outside. 
                We ride around our block and sometimes on our neighborhood street. 
                I am currently 14 years of age and I am going into the 9th grade. 
                I would like to really get into cybersecurity as my future job, that is why I am in this amazing/outstaing program.</p>

                <div id="gallery-desc">One of my favorite airlines, Southwest. 
                    This is a plane landing at an airport.
                This airline has very comfortable seats.
            It can be expensive but it is surely worth it!
            I have flown on this plane many many times to many different places and I haven't had any bad comments about this airline.
            I would surely fly on this airline again.

                <div id="gallery-desc">This is one of my favorite games, Rocket league. 
                    This is literally soccer but you are just using a car and trying to score goals. 
                    Don't let your opposing team score all of the points on you, unless you want to lose.
                I have played this game many many times and I loved it!
            I haven't played it in a while, but when I did play it was awesome!</div>

                <div id="gallery-desc">This is a very awesome snipe, for the win too!
                    I love using snipers in Call of Duty. 
                    Call of Duty is my second favorite game out of these gifs. 
                    I have been playing this game for a while.
                    I've played it with my friends, my brothers, and many more people that I have found off of school or Call of Duty.
                    I use many different guns on Call of Duty but I mostly use the sniper when it is a sniper map.
                    I was actually planning on playing Call of Duty today.

                    This is my all time favorite game, GtaV.
                    This is also a very awesome trickshot, I have never seen somene do this before.
                    I have actually tried to recreate this trickshot but you know how it ended.
                    It obviously didn't work.
                    I am lucky to have found this as a gif.

                    This is the very old classic game of Rock Paper Scissors. 
                    We made this game by coding it on Visual Studio Code! I had a lot of fun coding this. 
                    I was having fun and learning at the same time.
                    Rock Paper Scissors was my favorite game.
                    I played it a lot with my brothers and different people for fun.
                    I would keep a track of how many wins and loses I had.
                    I don't play Rock Paper Scissors that much.
                    I only play it when I am bored or like when I am participating in some kind of competition.

                   This is another code that I did and it was converting Fahrenheit To Celsius.
                   We had to do a lot of code that took a few days but we got it done.
                   I also had fun coding this and I was excited to start coding this.
                   I needed a little help but while I was getting help the instructor was telling me how it works.
                   We also chose what color the numbers were going to print.
                   We had like 75 or higher would be red because it was hot.
                   We also had like 40 or below would be blue.
                   Lastly we had 41-74 would be yellow because it was in the middle.

        <div class="clear Experience"><h1>Experience</h1><p1>My experience so far at The Hidden Genius Project has been very fun. 
            We do so many different things everyday. 
            This is the best program that I have ever been in. 
            They provide us with foods from many different places that I have never had before. 
            I hope that I stay in touch with this program once I get out of it. I may even consider on working here. 
            This program is also helping me with my future goals. 
            This is the thing that I would like to do in the future. 
            I am making history by being Baltimore's first cohart.
            This program has helped me a lot with what I would like to become one day.
            They teach black male youth in many different things such as coding and leadership skills.
            This program should never stop.
            I am thinking about on becoming an Y.E one day.</p1></div>
        <div id="Goals"><h1>Goals</h1><p1>There are so many goals that I would like to accomplish. 
            One of the goals that I would like to accomplish is getting into a high paying job and investing in stocks. 
            Another goal that I would like to accomplish is giving back to my community just like The Hidden Genius Project. 
            They give back to their community. 
            These are just some of the many goals that I would like to accomplish.
            One other goal that I would like to accomplish is spending more time with family and friends.
            It's not like we have them forever.
            You might see them one day and the next day they are gone.
            That's why I want to soend time with them.</p1></div>
